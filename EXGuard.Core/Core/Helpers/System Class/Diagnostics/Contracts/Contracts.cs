** Class:  Contract
** 
** <OWNER>Microsoft,mbarnett</OWNER>
**
** Purpose: The contract class allows for expressing preconditions,
** postconditions, and object invariants about methods in source
** code for runtime checking & static analysis.
**
** Two classes (Contract and ContractHelper) are split into partial classes
** in order to share the public front for multiple platforms (this file)
** while providing separate implementation details for each platform.
